# easterlywave
Personal project. `easterlywave` is a website hosting some interesting maps/plots under construction. It's written by Python and Django.

Currently, I am working on these webapps:
- `windygram` fetching ECMWF forecast data for specific locations from windy.com and visualizing it.
- `percipstat` (private) collecting daily percipitation summary of provincal capitals of China.

To be added:
- ECMWF ensemble of tropical cyclones tracks
- ECMWF model forecast

Any contribution is bigly appreciated!
